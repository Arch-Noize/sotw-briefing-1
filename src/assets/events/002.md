Now done with the duel and getting to know the rest of their class, the new blood of the Karrakin Cavalry College went ahead and made their own connections and assisted their other classes for their first day.

**Yarin** and **Leman** weren't comfortable in the gaudy palace-like common room they found themselves in. Despite neither of them being the most talkative and approachable of people, they seemed to share their views about the college... And so did **__Captain Hedros__**, a BUC soldier seen as a 'young buck' with several medals under his belt from *House of Dust*. A man that reminded them that this place wasn't fancy just for show. Being here took dedication and effort, otherwise, they wouldn't last a day in the college. He invited them not to get comfortable if they couldn't, but rather to appreciate the fruit of their labor. With a little banter after recognizing he was pit against the two, he gave them the small warning that '*if they see the glint, it was already too late*'.

**Lady Camille** and **CALIGRAND** sparked a conversation with the **__Primors Vivian and Valentine__**, two exotic students from *House of Glass* after hearing the twins tease their 'sense of fashion'. Hearing their house name — Reis — Camille recognized their house, albeit minor, specializes in exotic technology and fashion. Even under a Ispahsalari lens, the twins radiated this sense of mercurial attitude. Looking to make allies and charm the fellow students, Lady Camille clicked with the twins by requesting their personal advice on a fancier dress for her 'babysitter' NHP.

And lastly, Quinn got to meet **__Lady Kiriona__**, from *House of Moments* and **__Principissa Elsa__**, from *House of Order*. The former showing how to perform a complex trick shot with a pistol and a pair of small, heavily dented personal drones. While Elsa seemed uninterested, Quinn got to talk with infectiously exciting lady from House of Moments. The shy girl wanted to give it a shot while talking with the two students. Failing once, but ***perfectly*** hitting the drones the second time, bringing some small admiration from the Brightstar of House of Moments and... *The daughter of Archchancellor Sigune Zoeva.*
