It was their second day on the college and the kuirassers found themselves on the first, non-duel simulation of combat.  Designed to push students to excel by forcing them to compete against each other. This particular skirmish is intended to test techniques specific to urban warfare, including the proper use of cover and area control in a dense environment. The other students were generally friendly competitors, and the mood before the skirmish is one of excitement.

Tasked with taking control of zones, the kuirassers planned on splitting and taking as many zones as they can as well as push back the other students. ... A task easier said than done, as their HUDs registered:
- **Captain Hedros** — under the callsign of **'Zero'** — using a long range mech and anti-materiel rifle that locked down its enemies that weren't behind cover, **punishing them with deadly aim**.
- **Principissa Elsa** — under the callsign of **'Sapphire'** — using a support mech that organized, commanded, and repaired her fellow allies.
- **Primors Vivian and Valentine** — under the callsigns of **'Goldenrod'** and **'Rose'** respectively — using exotic, xeno mechs that confused even I.K.O.L, as readings of their systems and frames lead nowhere.
- **Lady Kiriona** — under the callsign of **'Brightstar'** — with a heavy, and yet, incredibly fast mech that sought to pin her enemies down.
- And **Kay** — under the callsign of **'Sparky'** — with a large obstructing mech that blocked off  points and continuously slowed down targets. 

Though both teams fought for the control zones with all their might, only one could stand victorious.

**Quinn** took to the center of the cross of the street to soak up focus and push forward towards the other points. But Cpt. Hedros seemed to be a keen sniper, taking several shots at whoever else was exposed and destroying several parts of **CALIGRAND's** mech. The twin Primors took advantage of their exotic technology to quickly teleport and attack their opponent students from up close. Whatever damage their mechs received seemed to be slowly repaired by itself thanks to the unknown material they were built with

All the while **Yarin** and **Leman** fought straight on against Lady Kiriona—who dashed through the battlefield to pin down anyone her way, Principissa Elsa—who used several drones and sealant guns to both repair her allies and slow down, and Kay—who weaponized gravity to lock down the two.

And thus... With CALIGRAND's heavy artillery, Leman's turrets, Quinn's pushing, and Yarin and Lady Camille's backup, their team won by ***__one__ point***. Earning praises and cheering from their opponents and tutor, **Underbaron Iphianassa** herself alike
